# CrewAI POC - Question & Answer System

A simple proof-of-concept application demonstrating CrewAI's agent collaboration capabilities. This application features two agents working together: one to answer questions and another to evaluate the quality of those answers.

## Features

- **Answering Agent**: Provides comprehensive answers to user questions
- **Evaluation Agent**: Assesses answer quality, accuracy, and completeness
- **Interactive CLI**: Simple command-line interface for asking questions
- **YAML Configuration**: Maintainable agent and task definitions

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure API key**:
   - Copy `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the application
2. Enter your question when prompted
3. Wait for the answering agent to process your question
4. Review the evaluation agent's assessment of the answer
5. Type 'quit' to exit
